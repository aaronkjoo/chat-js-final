<h1>JS Chat Website ðŸ’¬ ðŸ‘¾</h1>


This is a chat UI built entirely with Javascript (React specifically). ðŸ˜ƒ

All you need to run the webstie is have NPM installed on your computer!

To run the website, clone the directory, cd into it with your terminal:

1. Create an account at https://chatengine.io/
2. Create a project on your newly created account and have your project ID and private key handy from the project settings.
3. In Visual Studio Code, navigate to the index.js file in your backend directory and replace "XXXX" with your private key from step 2.
4. In Visual Studio Code, navigate to the frontend/src directory and replace "XXXX" with your project id from step 2.
5. In a Visual Studio terminal, cd into your backend directory and run the command "npm start".
6. In another Visual Studio terminal, cd into your frontend directory and run the command "npm install".
7. Then, once all your dependencies are installed, run the command "npm run dev".
8. Control + click on the http server which will open a new tab in your browser.

You can now create an account, create chat messages, and login as another user, and talk to each other.

Done! ðŸŽ‰
